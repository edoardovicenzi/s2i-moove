# ðŸš€ Welcome to the Moove project!

(DISCLAMER: THIS IS A PROJECT FOR START2IMPACT)

Moove is a leading company in shared micromobility. Our vehicles are available in 20 European cities. The vehicles made available are bicycles, scooters and mopeds, all electric. We want to integrate sustainable, shared and affordable mobility into everyday life.

Our founder was born in a large city where there are several different means of transport to get around without a car: tram, metro, bus. She has always dreamed of being able to materialize her bike around the city on foot or when she didn't want to wait for the tram. With this idea, she created Moove.

### Our Mission

Flexible micromobility solutions that are convenient and environmentally friendly is our goal.

### How does it work?

The vehicles are freely parked in the city and are available to citizens and tourists. To use a vehicle, you need to download the app, activate geolocation and book the closest desired vehicle. You can choose between hourly, daily or monthly rates.
